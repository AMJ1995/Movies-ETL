# Repository Summary

In this repository, I used ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) to write various functions that allowed me to read three data files provided to me. These data files were in CSV form as well as JSON form. In the VScode application, I began by importing Sqlalchemy, Pandas, Numpy and Json. These imports are essential for writing the codes I needed to execute.

I extracted and and transformed the provided wikipedia data and kaggle data in the second and third deliverables and I ultimately created a movie database that I then added to a SQL database in Postgres.

The CSV files and JSON file are provided in this repository's "Resources" folder, which also contains PNG files that are snapshots of SQL queries that I ran in Postgres to count the number of rows in the tables I created.
